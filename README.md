# Custom Channel

Shows how to implement a custom channel with [messaging](https://github.com/botpress/messaging)

This example implements a simple discord channel. To test it you will need to run a standalone messaging server and create a discord bot. Then fill all the required info in the src/config.json file. You need to configure a webhook to point to http://localhost:3124/callback to receive messages from messaging
